<td valign="middle"><h3>On graduation day of <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama (P)">SMKAP</abbr> after successfully graduating from high school for 5 years together became one of the unforgettable memories.
An educational institution that shaped me and my friends to become better human beings started in this waqf land.
Baiah solehah in this environment became a new point five years ago but now the end of the secondary school session is not the total end.
On the other hand, my friends and I are happy because on that day a new point of life will begin where we will move to a higher level of education to achieve our dreams.

He used to serve as a Malaysia Naval Force in his life before pension and started to open his own business.

It caused itchy and rash all over my body. Before going to the hospital, I already checked with the Health Unit of UiTM since it occured when I’m at the college. 
Then, I visited a dermatologist clinic before deciding to take days off and went back to my hometown. I got a total of 5 injections from this allergic reaction
but luckily I’m not experiencing any systemic symptoms.
